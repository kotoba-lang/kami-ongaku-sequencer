  "E2E-only, worklet-side bundle for kami-ongaku-sequencer's real-browser
   AudioWorkletProcessor SMF-round-trip-to-playback proof (see README,
   'Real-browser AudioWorklet SMF round-trip proof'). Requires
   kotoba-lang/audio's own audio.synth (real oscillator + ADSR DSP) directly
   -- not a reimplementation -- on top of the shared
   kami.ongaku.sequencer.e2e.fixture (this repo's OWN kami.ongaku.sequencer /
   kami.ongaku.sequencer.smf real event/SMF-codec logic, also required
   unmodified by test/e2e/run_e2e.cljs's offline nbb cross-check).

   Built the same way as org-w3-webaudio's and kami-ongaku-sampler's own
   test/e2e/src/.../worklet_dsp.cljs (:optimizations advanced +
   self-polyfill.js prepended -- see scripts/build-e2e-bundles.sh and
   org-w3-webaudio's README for the full root-cause derivation of why this
   combination is required inside AudioWorkletGlobalScope) -- that recipe is
   reused verbatim here, not rediscovered.

   Exposes one render-pattern entrypoint via ^:export (-> goog.exportSymbol
   -- NOT a manual `(set! (.-x js/goog.global) f)`, which is not safe
   against Closure's :advanced whole-program DCE, per org-w3-webaudio's own
   worklet_dsp.cljs docstring), callable from the hand-written
   AudioWorkletProcessor tail (test/e2e/page/worklet-processor-tail.js) at
   its munged path kami.ongaku.sequencer.e2e.worklet_dsp.render_pattern.

   render-pattern takes NO arguments: the pattern (5 real note events),
   tempo/PPQ, and the real export-smf -> import-smf round trip are all
   deterministic and live in fixture.cljc, required by BOTH this bundle and
   the offline nbb reference -- there is nothing to pass across the
   MessagePort boundary except the (informational) computed plan, echoed
   back for the offline reference to bit-exactly cross-check."
